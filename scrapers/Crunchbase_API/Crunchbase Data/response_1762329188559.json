      "About": "Dutch is a veterinary telehealth service that specializes in treating anxiety and allergies in pets. At Dutch, we’re on a mission to treat the curable ailments that keep our pets from living their best lives. Many of our pets suffer from chronic conditions such as allergies and anxiety. Sadly, many also go untreated. Traditional vet appointmentsare inconvenient, expensive, and often stressful for our best friends. This leads to putting off wellness visits until a pain point is unignorable and frequently pushing quality-of-life issues under the rug. This is the reality of pet healthcare in the U.S. — but we know we can do better. By using telehealth solutions to connect pet parents with licensed veterinarians, Dutch makes veterinary visits convenient and practical. Dutch-affiliated vets work with your pet over time, whenever they need it, allowing our veterinarians to go beyond the symptoms and identify the root cause of your pet’s chronic suffering. We prescribe treatments and prescriptions that are medically backed, specialized to individual cases, and delivered directly to your door. Dutch currently operates in the following eight states: New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, South Dakota, Virginia, Idaho, and Indiana.Read More ",

The team is made up of investors, engineers and scientists who use artificial intelligence (“AI”) and data science to model venture-backed private companies.Beyond investment capital, Tribe deploys these AI tools toseparate signal from noise, helping our companies understand their businesses better.  Our data-informed strategy includes an underwriting infrastructure and a quantitative analysis tool called the “Magic 8-ball.” We leverage these tools to provide deep insight on factors driving growth and how to accelerate sustainable growth, honed through years of developing similar products at major tech and finance players like Lyft, Yahoo, Facebook, and Bridgewater Associates.  Our team uses these tools to measure quantitative product-market fit, so we can more effectively assess and accelerate what Tribe refers to as “N-of-1” companies - companies with the potential to be 10-100x growth opportunities, while minimizing loss ratio by a large degree.
