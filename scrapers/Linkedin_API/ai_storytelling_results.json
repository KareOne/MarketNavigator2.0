If you reach out to me to sell generative AI for creative development, I am deleting that request or email.\nWhat surprises me... is how often these senders clearly haven’t taken the time to understand their audience, what I do, or what I stand for. Do a little background check..lol. My career has been built around human creativity, and the artists that we hire are the lifeblood of our game. I will never use generative AI to develop creative work, whether it is art, narrative, video, or anything else. Generative AI is built on unlicensed, uncompensated, unethical use of artists’ work…its stolen.\nThe way I think about it is simple. When I go to a restaurant, I want a chef who cooks by hand, someone who puts their expertise, training, and soul into the dish. That is where the artistry is. But let a robot wash the dishes, clean the workspace, or organize the tools. Automation has its place. Let the artist focus on their craft. \nBut if we let AI become the chef, we lose the soul and the flavor. We lose the irreplaceable artistry that happens only when a human creates.\nFor me, that is non-negotiable.",

AI is transforming how market data is processed, how strategies are built, and how risks are managed in the ever-changing crypto landscape.\n\nWhy AI Matters in Crypto Trading\nUnlike traditional markets, crypto trades 24/7, generating vast amounts of real-time data. Prices can shift drastically within minutes due to sentiment shifts, regulatory news, whale movements, or social media trends. Human traders often struggle to keep up.\nAI, however, can:\nAnalyze massive datasets in milliseconds\nDetect hidden patterns and correlations\nExecute decisions without emotional bias\nContinuously learn and adapt from new information\nThis allows AI-driven systems to outperform manual strategies \n https://lnkd.in/gaKqha3f",

They're bundling GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet into one platform-no more subscription juggling.\n\nThe lifetime deal breaks down differently than expected:\n\n• 4 million monthly credits included\n• 1.1 million words or images generated\n• 450k bonus credits for daily login\n• Access to multiple AI models without switching platforms\n\nFor content creators, developers, and small teams, this consolidation makes sense. Instead of managing separate tools for writing, coding, and image generation, everything runs through one interface.\n\nThe credit system provides transparency that \"unlimited\" plans often hide behind throttling. You know exactly what you're getting.\n\nThe math works if you use AI tools regularly. Equivalent monthly cost hits around $6.25 over one year-way below what most people pay across multiple subscriptions.\n\nLifetime deals always carry service continuity risks. But for those of us building AI workflows, the consolidation value alone justifies the experiment.\n\nThe real test isn't the pricing model-it's whether unified access actually improves productivity over platform switching.\n\nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#ProductivityTools \nhashtag\n#TechDeals\n\n𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲꞉ https://lnkd.in/g6yGvQbQ",

It focuses on what to create when asked.\n\n\nIn contrast, Agentic AI is proactive and autonomous. It takes initiative, sets goals, plans multi-step workflows, makes decisions, adapts dynamically, and executes tasks with minimum supervision.\n\n\nGenerative AI powers content within these systems, but Agentic AI orchestrates entire processes to achieve goals efficiently, turning AI from a passive tool into an active partner driving outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis post gives you a glimpse of the newest addition to AWS’s agentic AI stack—Amazon QuickSuite.\nThe name says it all:\nQuick — enabling y \n https://lnkd.in/gPG35Y25",

This builds on the wide discourse currently occurring in this space. I wanted to write down my initial thoughts in an article on this very large and ever evolving topic. 📝 \n\nIn summary: \n🤖 AI is often hailed as a game-changer for climate adaptation, but it’s not a substitute for the deep expertise of climate scientists and adaptation advisors. While AI can process vast datasets, identify patterns, and run simulations, meaningful adaptation requires local knowledge, cultural understanding, and governance realities that algorithms alone can’t provide.\n\n🌏 Key applications of AI in adaptation planning include modeling large datasets, long-term predictive modeling (like Destination Earth) predicting disruptions using digital twins and risk maps (like Haskoning's TWINN tool) and supporting disaster preparedness through real-time monitoring and resource allocation. However these tools, while powerful, must be integrated into broader, system-based frameworks that consider local realities.\n\n🤝 The most successful climate adaptation strategies emerge from collaboration, where AI amplifies human capability rather than attempting to replace it. The future of climate adaptation must be shaped by hybrid approaches, with technology and human insight working hand in hand to build resilient communities and economies.\n\nhashtag\n#ClimateAdaptation \nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#Resilience \nhashtag\n#Sustainability \nhashtag\n#UrbanPlanning 🌱",

Customers today want quick answers, but they also want to feel understood. Generative AI is powerful because it has the potential to meet both needs, but only when it's applied thoughtfully.\nWhen I started piloting these tools with my teams, I was especially cautious about how we used AI for things like call summaries or email replies. Those tasks seem simple, but they carry weight. One mistake can shift the entire tone of a customer relationship.\nI remember a case where AI pulled a hypothetical example from a customer conversation and flagged it as a confirmed action item. The summary stated that a meeting with a major prospect had been scheduled, but in reality the client was just offering an example.\nThat kind of error could easily have led us down the wrong path if we hadn't reviewed the output carefully.\nThis is one of the most important things I stress with teams exploring generative AI: Always inspect what the technology delivers.\nFully 66% of employees rely on AI output without verifying its accuracy, according to a KPMG survey. Not verifying AI output can often lead to easily preventable mistakes. We still need human judgment. AI can surface insights and draft messages, but it doesn't understand nuance the way people do. We have to train it, monitor it, and stay involved.\nWhen used well, though, AI can genuinely improve the experience for customers and teams alike.\nI've seen AI-generated responses that reference past purchases, tailor product recommendations, and even adjust tone based on sentiment. These tools help deliver more personalized service without overwhelming agents. And that's key, because customers notice when a response feels specific to them instead of a copy-paste job.\nAI also supports self-service in ways that couldn't be done before. Knowledge bases can be updated automatically based on frequent issues, which helps customers find answers on their own. That means fewer tickets, faster resolutions, and a more empowered customer experience.\nhttps://lnkd.in/gezTmrNc",

There's no human judgment or intuition here, just a binary pass/fail.\n\nSo what can you do? How do you beat this unfair game?\n\nWell... by using AI as well!\nYou can use generative AI like ChatGPT or Claude to help practice interviews and come up with clever questions that AI might ask you during the screening.\n\nBUT. There's a problem.\n\nGenerative AI is, well, generative, meaning it doesn't have any structure in the questions it generates. It doesn't have a complete understanding of ALL the topics that can come up in a QA interviews.\n\nIt doesn't understand the interconnected nature of QA.\n\nAnd this isn't just a guess. This is constant feedback you can read on Reddit, LinkedIn, or X from hundreds of QAs who've tried using generative AI for interview prep.\n\nSo here's my question to you:\n\nHow did you solve this problem? Were you successful using ChatGPT or similar tools as interview prep? Did you try any specialized AI tools like QAmiAI (https://qamiai.com) ? How did it go?",

          "caption": "Everyone says generative AI will transform productivity, but the truth is far more uneven. Some firms are seeing impressive gains. Others are discovering that most pilot projects quietly fail. The real story sits in the gap between hype and genuine capability.\n\nOne of the most encouraging studies comes from Stanford and MIT. When customer service agents were given AI assistance, productivity rose by about 15 per cent. The biggest gains came from newer employees, who saw improvements of more than 30 per cent. The tools acted like an experienced colleague whispering advice over your shoulder. Over time, workers who used AI did not become dependent. They became more skilled. Customer satisfaction also improved.\n\nYet outside these controlled environments, the picture changes. A recent survey by MIT’s Project NANDA found that 95 per cent of private sector generative AI pilots are failing. Many firms tried to build outward facing systems for sales or marketing without the right data, governance or expertise. The successful ones focused on narrow and stable back office tasks with a higher tolerance for errors. They approached AI with discipline, not excitement.\n\nThe lesson is clear. Generative AI is powerful, but only when organisations redesign workflows, invest in people and start with the right problems. AI works best when it augments judgement rather than replaces it. It works best where errors can be managed rather than where accuracy must be absolute.\n\nWe need more realism and fewer grand declarations. Firms that approach AI as a long term capability will gain. Those that treat it as a shortcut will join the ninety five per cent.\n\nThe productivity revolution is possible, but it will not arrive through enthusiasm alone. It will arrive through careful design, patient learning and practical application.",

Unlike traditional static competitive analysis, ABNF utilizes a dynamically evolving Bayesian network to incorporate real-time data streams from diverse sources, enabling more accurate and responsive predictions of market shifts and competitor actions. The core innovation lies in the adaptive structure of the Bayesian network, which dynamically adjusts its variables, conditional dependencies, and prior probabilities based on observed data. This allows for a nuanced understanding of complex, multi-faceted competitive environments and facilitates proactive strategic decision-making. ABNF aims to provide a 25-35% improvement in forecast accuracy compared to prevailing methodologies, impacting strategic planning, resource allocation, and market entry decisions across a range of industries.
